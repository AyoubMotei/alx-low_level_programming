This repository contains programs in C language that demonstrate how to manipulate bits. Below are the details of the programs available in this repository.

Programs

0-binary_to_uint.c
This program contains a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

1-print_binary.c
This program contains a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

2-get_bit.c
This program contains a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

3-set_bit.c
This program contains a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

Task 4
Write a function clear_bit that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

Task 5
Write a function flip_bits that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

Task 6
Write a function get_endianness that checks the endianness.

Task 7
