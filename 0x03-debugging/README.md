Debugging Tasks
This repository contains solutions to the Debugging project tasks.

Files
Filename	Description
0-main.c	Test for a positive_or_negative() function
1-main.c	Program that causes an infinite loop
2-main.c	Program that prints the largest of three integers
2-largest_number.c	Function that returns the largest of three numbers
Tasks
0. Multiple mains
Create a file named 0-main.c that tests the positive_or_negative() function with a case of 0. You are not coding the solution/function, you're just testing it. You only need to upload 0-main.c and main.h for this task.

1. Like, comment, subscribe
Comment out the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.

2. 0 > 972?
Fix the largest_number() function in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three integers in the 2-main.c program.

3. Leap year
This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
